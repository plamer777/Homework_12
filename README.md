# Homework 12 inspired by Flask

Here is a pretty simple Flask application created by using blueprints.

**The project is divided by few parts**:
1. Data - contains JSON file with posts data
2. Loader - blueprint using to upload new posts
3. Main - blueprint using to search posts by a key phrase
4. Logs - here's a log file
5. Managers - contains post_manager and logger_builder
6. Uploads - Here's all pictures
7. Root directory - contains main application file - app.py
